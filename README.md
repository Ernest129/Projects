EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models

A Python implementation of the **EM algorithm** for fitting **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** to data. Includes:
- Synthetic mixture data generation
- Convergence diagnostics
- Comparison with K-Means clustering
- Visualizations of parameter recovery

## Project Background 
This project was developed for **Bayesian Networks and Hidden Markov Models** at **The University of Bucharest**. It demonstrates:
- Mathematical understanding of mixture models and EM
- Implementation skills in Python
- Experimental analysis of algorithm behavior
